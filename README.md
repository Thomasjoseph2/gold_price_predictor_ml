Gold Price Predictor
This project uses a Random Forest regressor to predict the price of gold based on historical data.

Data
The data used in this project is from the Quandl API. It includes daily gold prices from 2008-01-02 to 2020-08-28.

Model
The model used in this project is a Random Forest regressor. This model was chosen because it is a powerful and versatile model that can handle non-linear relationships and missing data.

Evaluation
The model was evaluated using the R-squared score. The R-squared score is a measure of how well the model fits the data. A score of 1.0 indicates a perfect fit, while a score of 0.0 indicates that the model does not fit the data at all.

The model achieved an R-squared score of 0.95 on the test data.

Conclusion
The Random Forest regressor is a powerful and effective model for predicting the price of gold. This model can be used to make informed investment decisions.
